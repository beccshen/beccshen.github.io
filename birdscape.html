        <h3>Academic project<br>Washington University in St. Louis<br>
            ARCH 312 / Spring 2019<br>
            Critic: Jacqueline Margetts<br>
            ASLA St. Louis Chapter Award of Excellence</h3>
      
         Birds are a charming yet vital component of biodiversity within the urban realm. This intervention is designed specifically for the purple martin, a bird species that prefers human-made habitats. Purple martins become welcomed yet unexpecting new neighbors for the human residents of the West End Neighborhood in St. Louis.<br><br>
  
  The Hodiamont Tracks Greenway is a new community initiative that replaces the old Hodiamont Tracks streetcar railway, catalyzing a series of efforts to reinvigorate the underserved neighborhood, including connectivity to amenities, well-designed public open spaces, and community-engaging activities along the new greenway.
      Birdscape, located at a narrow site chosen between the Kipp Victory Academy and Hylton Point Senior Home, serves as an activation node of ecological and social interactions.<br><br>
       A pathway connecting the greenway, lined with strikingly-designed martin birdhouses, is a corridor for engagement betweeen humans and the sociable purple martin birds.
      Underneath, a bioswale gradually widens into a Pickerelweed wetland pond adjacent to the greenway, retaining and filtering excess stormwater runoff. 
        The formal layout of the intervention between an elementary school and senior home creates opportunities for community engagement between residents, senior citizens, and schoolchildren through ecological learning, which runs parallel with the emergence of a rich habitat designed for the fruition of the purple martin avian species.
        Ultimately, this landscape provides opportunities for new and enriching social and ecological relationships between residents of the urban realmâ€”humans, animals, and plants alike.<br><br>

             Purple martins migrate thousands of miles every year across the Americas, yet, they stay loyal to the same nesting sites. The proposed intervention, rich with purple martin-specific dwelling opportunities and food resources, entices these birds to return year after year to a neighborhood site in their annual migratory journeys.

         The last streetcar ran its final course on the Hodiamont Tracks in May of 1966. Now, the Hodiamont Tracks is a desolate back alley through the West End neighborhood. Great Rivers Greenway of St. Louis is transforming the tracks into a greenway. The initiative will catalyze a series of efforts to reinvigorate the underserved neighborhood with increased connectivity to amenities, public green spaces, and community-engaging activities along the new greenway.

                   <a href="Birdscape/img_plan.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="<b>Plan of Proposal</b><br>A metal-grated boardwalk links the neighborhood to the greenway. Smaller paths branch off from the main boardwalk to connect to the adjacent senior home and elementary school.  A bioswale running parallel to the boardwalk directs roadwater to a small wetland. The metal grating allows water and bird droppings to seep through, benefitting the plants underneath and allowing them to grow through the grating.

         Adjacent to the greenway is the wetland pond, an ecologically intense area that provides habitat to an immense network of insects, 
         the food source for the purple martins. 
         Gabion seating along the edge of the greenway provides social interaction opportunity.
         <br><br>
         The pickerelweed, an attractive aquatic perennial, is planted in the wetland pond for its ability to filter pollutants from stormwater runoff by taking in excess nitrogen and phosphorus.

         Martin Houses (birdhouses designed for the purple martin bird species) are attached to tall poles that line the boardwalk.

         The Braconid wasp penetrates a host, whether it be a caterpillar or a plant, with its ovipositor, 
         or egg-laying mechanism that is attached at the back of its abdomen. 
         This drawing depicts the process by which the ovipositor penetrates the host.

         Pickerelweed was the selected plant for the wetland for its efficiency in filtering contaminated soil, air,
          and water by uptaking excess nitrogen and phosphorus. Pickerelweed is a flowering perennial that attracts various beneficial insects,
           such as the blue dasher dragonfly and the braconid wasp, both of which are also common food sources for purple martin birds.
