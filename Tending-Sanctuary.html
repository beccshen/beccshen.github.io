      Tending Sanctuary is a multispecies ethnography of VINE Sanctuary, a place and landscape that is designed through an ethos that centers farmed animals protagonists, thereby acknowledging them as co-creators of the sanctuary.
      VINE Sanctuary is a 100-acre farmed animal sanctuary in the re-forested mountains of Vermont on a site that is presumed to have once been decimated for the timber industry and/or sheep farming industry. The sanctuary’s rugged, biodiverse landscape is home to over 700 rescued, formerly farmed animals who exercise their newfound agency to form complex social and ecological relationships with humans, wild animal and plant species, and the material landscape.
      <br><Br>
        This book consists of the following chapters: <b>The Sanctuary, The Landscape Architect, The Forest, The Soil, The Residents</b>, and <b>The Stewards</b>.
      The chapters in this book describe, illustrate, and map the physical attributes of the landscape, together telling the stories of how the residents self-actualize, build community, co-create spaces, and affect material and ecological cycles. Perceiving the ecological and social landscape as one that is shaped by healing domesticated animal actors brings a new awareness of what it means to practice a land ethic and animal ethic together.
      In addition, this work looks beyond studying landscape through the species lens—whereby each species is viewed as a monolith and valued by its ecosystem contribution—and looks instead toward a multispecies lens, which simultaneously recognizes that more-than-human beings are socio-ecologically entangled and each individual actor also has inherent worth, histories, and worldviews. 
<br><Br>

This project draws upon ethnographic fieldwork methods of immersed observation. Landscape descriptions rely on my first-hand accounts of living on the site for several weeks, participating in daily and weekly routines, and engaging with the members of the multispecies community.
This project contributes to a growing body of research in the rising genre of multispecies ethnography and incorporates its framework into landscape site research. 
<br><br>
One creative methodology that I deployed was <b>movement mapping</b>, which is elaborated upon in The Residents chapter. This methodology, which I conceived after already spending some time at VINE Sanctuary, involved tracing the movements and locations of selected residents at regular time intervals (such as every 10 minutes) for a total about five contiguous hours per day.
At each time interval, I marked the location of the resident, each denoted by a different map symbol, and took note of individual, group, and climatic changes. This focused and immersive methodology allowed me to understand new dimensions of agency that included observing spatial patterns, individual and collective social tendencies, and routines over time.
The maps' lines and marks embody a significant space and time frame in which I was directly in relationship with and had undivided awareness of the residents. The mappings embody their agency by recording their day-to-day experiences and ability to move freely, a result of their ongoing physical and social recovery from their fraught pasts while residing in the safety of sanctuary.
<br><br>
This work hopes to highlight the landscape of VINE Sanctuary as a model for designing sanctuary landscapes that foster individual and collective agency and the healing of both animals and the land.
The work also highlights a fruitful methodological outcome, movement mapping, and an attitude of observation of nonhuman animal communities that gives identity to the members as sentient subjects with agency.
