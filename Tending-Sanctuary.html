      Tending Sanctuary is a multispecies ethnography of VINE Sanctuary that illuminates a perspective on landscape as an assemblage of multispecies relationships with domesticated nonhuman residents as protagonists. VINE Sanctuary is a 100-acre farmed animal sanctuary in the forested mountains of Vermont. The sanctuary’s rugged, biodiverse landscape is home to over 700 rescued, formerly farmed animals who exercise their newfound agency to form complex social and ecological relationships with humans, wild animal and plant species, and the material landscape. Together, the chapters in this book describe, illustrate, map the physical attributes of the landscape, and tell the stories of how the residents self-actualize, build community, co-create spaces, and affect material and ecological cycles.
      <br><br>
      This book consists of the following chapters: <b>The Sanctuary, The Landscape Architect, The Forest, The Soil, The Residents,</b> and </b>The Stewards.</b>
      Methodologically, this project draws upon ethnographic fieldwork methods of thorough, integrated observation.
      The description of the landscape relies on first-hand accounts of living on the site for several weeks, participating in daily and weekly routines, and engaging with the members of the multispecies community. 
      This project contributes to a growing body of research in the rising genre of multispecies ethnography and incorporates its framework into ethnographic landscape research.
      <br><br>
      One creative methodology that I deployed was <b>movement mapping</b>, which is elaborated upon in <b>The Residents</b> chapter. The movement mapping involved tracing the movements and locations of selected residents at regular time intervals (such as every 10 minutes) for a total about five contiguous hours per day.
      At each time interval, I marked the location of the resident, each denoted by a different symbol, taking note of individual, group, and climatic changes.
      This focused and immersive methodology allowed me to understand new dimensions of agency that included individual social tendencies, collectivity, engaging physically with spaces, and routines over time.
      These social dimensions of agency across the dynamic landscape uncovered the residents’ embodied day-to-day experiences and demonstrate the individual and collective ways they have physically and socially recovered wfrom their fraught pasts and found refuge within the unique setting of the sanctuary.
      <br><br>This work foregrounds the multispecies community at VINE Sanctuary as an opening to understand and compare the landscapes they came from and the landscape they now find refuge in. This work hopes to highlight the landscape of VINE Sanctuary as a model for designing landscapes that foster individual and collective agency and healing of both animals and the land, a step toward realizing interspecies justice.
