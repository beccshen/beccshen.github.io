        </h3>
      
           Rooted in Place is a neighborhood foodscape that simultaneously celebrates a multiplicity of cultural identities and fosters collective identity. It is set in Boston’s Fields Corner neighborhood, a multicultural mosaic defined by a strong Vietnamese population alongside Cape Verdean, Portuguese, Haitian, Irish, and Subsaharan African immigrants. Fields Corner is diverse; however, its ethnic communities remain disjoint.
<br><Br>
Cultivating local, culturally relevant food can help bridge these gaps. To start the dialogue, the project builds off existing community food and advocacy initiatives, tethering their activities to the physicality of the landscape. A Coalition of community members, organizations, developers, and agencies collaborate to tap into the productive and social potentials of mundane urban sites, such as vacant lots, embankments, and strip mall rooftops.
<br><Br>
The growing of rice and other culturally relevant food in uncanny landscapes serves as a potent metaphor for challenging the perceptions of belonging and difference. Through the tending of the foodscape—a collective commons—the Fields Corner residents proudly identify with the ground on which they live.
