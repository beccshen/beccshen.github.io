      Railroads have been one of the most significant agents of the expansion of the American frontier and the growth of the metropolis, carrying materials and people while linearly trespassing vast, rugged geologies and coastlines.
      In the inevitability of sea level rise, land use will change. Rather than becoming just another set of obselete infrastructures, coastal railroads can play an active role in the land's shifting uses.
     <br><Br>
      This project envisions a post-coastal retreat scenario at a site on Massachusett's coastline centered around an existing MBTA railroad and the city of Revere's barrier beach, which is highly subject to inundation in the next couple of decades.
      In this scenario, the barrier beach transitions from urban land use into a highly productive and community-owned landscape of shellfish cultivation. After the unbuilding of the most vulnerable properties due to their risks with near-future sea level rise, a landscape of labor emerges that relies on the collaboration of rails, water, and shellfish. 
      Shellfish aquaculture filters fouled waters and acts as a carbon sink, as shellfish leave behind shells composed of permanently-removed CO2 from the ocean.
      The rail corridor acts as a spine for the movement of material and people in situ, as well as regionally in the exchange of processed shellfish, ground up shells as soil fertilizer, and byproducts to restaurants, markets, farmers, and residents.
<br><br>
      This collectively-managed shellfish economy, serviced by the coastal rail and abandoned rails that the towns' industries originally grew upon, restores the reliance on the resources of the water and diverse social and economic services of the railroad. Simultaneously, the memory of Revere Beach as a cultural hallmark for the community is retained.

Ocean infrastructures and existing shellfish habitat<br>
Ocean infrastructures include channels, seawalls, barrier island systems, and tidal flats.
Mapped are the existing suitabilities of shellfish species at the site in relation to water salinity and sediment composition.
The diversity of these near shore ocean environments presents a great opportunity to utilize shellfish as agents of an emergent productive landscape.

   Mussel uses<br>
   Harvesting shellfish is highly effective and sustainable, as they are capable of cleaning out pollutants in water.
   Additionally, carbon is absorbed naturally from the ocean as the shell forms and grows. 
For humans, both the shells and the meat are useful resources, as shellfish are used for food and products, 
and crushed shells composed of calcium carbonate makes for excellent soil fertilizer.

Phases<br>
Much of Revere Beach will simply become inhabitable due to the general nature of barrier islands being subject to constant formation and erasure.
These phasing diagrams show how as sea level rises, the coastal fringes and shellfish habitats are evolving and migrating,
moving into low lying ground at Revere Beach and inland overtime.

  Proposal plan<br>
  This is a plan of a transitioned Revere Beach, where Blue mussel cultivation occurs in the inundated lowlying zones,
  while various clam species are cultivated in accumulated sediment along the re-formed beach frontier.
A new Riverworks station is activated that is a combined commuter station and shellfish facility.

Landscape of labor<br>
This littoral landscape is constantly in an amphibian condition that may allow for inundation with high and low tide, as well as sea level rise.
This aerial section perspective is an overview of the new landscape of labor,
revealing how the shellfish get brought to the intermittent rail from the mesh of shellfish production between the field of remaining building foundations and roads.

Speculative time table<br>
As a future kit, these schedules in the scale of a week speculate on overlapping shellfish shifts and commuter rush hour schedules at Riverworks. 
Ideal harvesting times are at low tides, which occur twice in a given day, as do commuter rush hours. However, tide occurrences do not operate on a fixed schedule like trains do.<br>
Additionally, shellfish depuration requires shellfish to be purified in tanks of salt water and UV light for a minimum of 42 hours before being distributed.

  Riverworks Station View<br>
  Here is the reimagined Riverworks station, which combines a commuter rail stop on the left, the electrified railroad in the middle,
   and the processing and depuration facility on the right. 
   Shellfish workers are unloading from the train, workers seen through the windows are preparing for the oncoming depuration and shell crushing shifts inside,
    and commuters wait on the platform and can purchase shellfish products in the station space under the elevated railroad.

Working view<br>
A view of a transitioned Revere Beach.
Overlayed are the names of previous streets, figments of the memory of the previous streetscape.
However, it is with hope that this emergent landscape and collectively managed shellfish economy which is serviced by the coastal rail and abandoned rails that the towns' industries originally grew upon, 
restores the reliance on the resources of the water and diverse services of the railroad. Simultaneously, the memory of Revere Beach as a cultural hallmark for the community is retained.
