         Birds are a charming yet vital component of biodiversity within the urban realm. This intervention is designed specifically to encourage the purple martin, a bird species that prefers human-made habitats, to nest within the West End neighborhood.<br><br>
  
  The Hodiamont Tracks Greenway, a new community initiative that replaces the old Hodiamont Tracks streetcar railway, is linked to the neighborhood through this Birdscape. Along the new greenway, a narrow site was chosen between the Kipp Victory Academy and Hylton Point Senior Home, serving as an activation node of ecological and social interactions. A recreational pathway connecting the greenway to the site is lined with strikingly-designed martin bird-houses ultimately becomes a corridor for engagement betweeen the elderly, schoolschildren, neighbors, and purple martin birds. Underneath is a bioswale that gradually widens into a Pickerelweed wetland pond adjacent to the greenway, retaining and filtering excess stormwater runoff.<br><br>

         This interpretive map of the migration of the purple martin through the United States throughout the various season shows that St. Louis is a nesting site for the purple martin. Purple martins migrate thousands of miles every year across the Americas, yet, they stay loyal to the same nesting sites. The proposed intervention at a chosen node along the greenway acts as a miniature purple margin neighborhood rich with dwelling and food resources, enticing these birds to return year after year in their annual migratory journeys.

         The last streetcar ran its final course on the Hodiamont Tracks in May of 1966. Now, the Hodiamont Tracks is a desolate back alley through the West End neighborhood. Great Rivers Greenway of St. Louis is transforming the tracks greenway, redensifying the neighborhood with increased connectivity and community-engaging activities along the new greenway.

                   <a href="Birdscape/img_plan.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="<b>Plan of Proposal</b><br>A metal-grated boardwalk links the neighborhood to the greenway. Smaller paths branch off from the main boardwalk to connect to the adjacent senior home and elementary school.  A bioswale running parallel to the boardwalk directs roadwater to a small wetland. The metal grating allows water and bird droppings to seep through, benefitting the plants underneath and allowing them to grow through the grating.

         Adjacent to the greenway is the wetland pond, an ecologically intense area that provides habitat to an immense network of insects, 
         the food source for the purple martins. 
         Gabion seating along the edge of the greenway provides social interaction opportunity.
         <br><br>
         The pickerelweed, an attractive aquatic perennial, is planted in the wetland pond for its ability to filter pollutants from stormwater runoff by taking in excess nitrogen and phosphorus.
          Beneficial wetland insects, such as the Blue Dasher Dragonfly and Brachonid Wasp, 
          also depend on the pickerweed for ideal egg-laying sites and nectar.

         The location of the intervention between the Hylton Point senior home and the KIPP Elementary School provides social 
         learning opportunities between the seniors and the children through engagement with the purple martins.
         <br><br>
         Martin Houses (birdhouses designed for the purple martin bird species) are attached to tall poles that line the boardwalk. 
         Together, the existing utility poles and the martin houses create a street-like effect: an ecological corridor with social vibrancy.

         The Braconid wasp penetrates a host, whether it be a caterpillar or a plant, with its ovipositor, 
         or egg-laying tube that is attached at the back of its abdomen. 
         This drawing depicts the process by which the ovipositor penetrates the host.

         Pickerelweed was the selected plant for the wetland for its efficiency in filtering contaminated soil, air,
          and water by uptaking excess nitrogen and phosphorus. Pickerelweed is a flowering perennial that attracts various beneficial insects,
           such as the Blue Dasher Dragonfly and the Braconid Wasp, both of which are common food for the purple martin birds.

         The Pickerelweed plant wetland provides the home for the habitat, 
         with its inhabitants including the mosquito, Braconid wasp, Blue dasher dragonfly, and of course, the Purple martin.
